# esp32-sleep-detection

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple embedded system that detects eye closure in real-time using an ESP32-CAM. The system processes images locally on the microcontroller and triggers a hardware alert via an LED when the eyes appear closed. The project is designed as a proof-of-concept for edge computing applications in embedded vision systems.
